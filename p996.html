                    <h2>The History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Introduced for 1999 and replacing the 993 generation (the last of the air-cooled 911s), the 996 was praised for its performance but derided by many die-hard enthusiasts for its switch to water cooling, an overly-muffled engine/exhaust note, the Boxster-sourced front-end styling and some cheap interior components that had no place in a $70,000-plus car.

                        And it all comes wrapped up in (apart from the headlights) classic 911 style. As such, those who want the thrill of driving a high-performing Porsche 911 that won’t cost them fifty grand or more should strongly consider the 996. Word is getting out, however, and values are slowly on the rise.

                    Yet the reality is that compared to the vaunted 993, the 996 is lighter, more powerful, quicker and faster. It also boasts sharper handling and more powerful braking. And let’s not forget about heating and air conditioning systems which work really well. Lastly, an inexpensive modification known as the “Gundo hack” (wherein a small piece of pipe is spliced between the mufflers’ inlet and exhaust outlets) transforms the lackluster factory soundtrack, giving this 911 a truly pleasing growl when you lean on the throttle.

                        <h3>996 911 Carrera 2 & 4</h3>
                        <p>The Porsche 996 was a new design developed by Pinky Lai under Porsche design chief Harm Lagaay from 1992 to 1994;[4] it was the first 911 that was completely redesigned, and carried over little from its predecessor as Porsche wanted the design team to design a 911 for the next millennium. Featuring an all new body, interior, and the first water-cooled engine, the 996 replaced the 993 from which only the front suspension, rear multi-link suspension, and a 6-speed manual transmission were retained in revised form. The 996 had a drag coefficient of Cd=0.30 resulting from hours spent in the wind tunnel. The 996 is 185 mm (7 in) longer and 40 mm (2 in) wider than its predecessor. It is also 45% stiffer courtesy of a chassis formed from high-strength steel. Additionally, it is 50 kg (110 lb) lighter despite having additional radiators and coolant.</p>

                    <h3>996 911 Carrera S & 4S</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2002, the standard Carrera models underwent the above-mentioned facelift. In addition, engine capacity was also increased to 3.6-litres across the range, yielding gains of 11 kW (15 PS; 15 hp) for the naturally aspirated models. 2002 also marked the start of the production of the 996 based Targa model, with a sliding glass "green house" roof system as introduced on its predecessor. It also features a rear glass hatch which gave the driver access to the storage compartment.[10] Also in 2002, the Carrera 4S model was first introduced. The C4S, as it is called among the enthusiasts, shares the wide-body look of the Turbo as well as the brakes and suspension.

                    <h3>996 911 Carrera Turbo</h3>
                    <p>
                        The 996 Turbo debuted at the Frankfurt Auto show in September 1999 and went on sale in the US in summer of 2000 as a 2001 model. The Turbo is powered by a water-cooled twin-turbocharged and intercooled 3.6-litre flat-6 engine derived from the 1998 Le Mans winning 911 GT1 race car. The engine is rated at 309 kW (420 PS; 414 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 415 lb⋅ft (563 N⋅m) of torque. It features an all-wheel drive system and was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed Tiptronic transmission. It has revised styling and a wider stance than the naturally aspirated 996 Carrera models, along with new bi-xenon headlamps and a fixed rear wing. The Turbo also came with VarioCam Plus and stability management, and on the US models, an electronically adjustable rear spoiler was included which would rise at a speed of 76 mph (122 km/h) and lower at 36 mph (58 km/h). The bodywork was also revised to allow airflow to 3 radiators up front and to accommodate 18-inch wheels and tyres.

                    <h3>996 911 Carrera GT3</h3>
                    <p>The GT3 was based on the standard 996 Carrera, but was stripped of a great deal of equipment for weight savings, featuring stiffer, adjustable suspension and upgraded brakes. The GT3 used the bodyshell of the four-wheel-drive Carrera 4, which incorporated additional front-end stiffening. The GT3 was produced in two versions. The first, commonly referred to as the Mk.I GT3, was introduced in 1999 in all markets, except North America. It featured a naturally aspirated 3.6-litre flat-six engine generating a maximum power output of 265 kW (360 PS; 355 hp).[18] This engine was shared with the 996 Turbo and was a derivative of the engine developed for the 911 GT1 race car. The Mk.II GT3 variant was based on the second generation of the 996, and featured updated aerodynamics, and a more powerful version of the 3.6 L engine from the MK.I, now rated at 280 kW (381 PS; 375 hp). The Mk.II was the first GT3 marketed in the North America. An Mk.II GT3 was tested in 2004 and accelerated from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 4.0 seconds, and produced 1.03 g on the skidpad, the second highest number ever recorded by a street-legal vehicle at the time.</p>

                    <h3>996 911 Carrera GT2</h3>
                    <p>the GT2, was rear-wheel drive as well, to save weight and to avoid power losses through the transmission (This is primarily due to the fact that the GT2 was built to compete in GT2 class racing, which restricted the use of an all-wheel-drive system). The GT2 received an added group of aerodynamic body parts, and a re-tuned version of the 996 Turbo's 3.6 litre, twin-turbocharged engine featuring larger turbochargers and intercoolers, a revised intake and exhaust system and re-programmed engine control software. The result was 356 kW (484 PS; 477 hp) at 5,700 rpm and 640 N⋅m (472 lbf⋅ft) at 3,500 to 4,500 rpm, enough to launch the car from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 3.9 seconds and to a top speed of 315 km/h (196 mph).[23] Bigger wheels and tyres along with lightweight ceramic brakes were standard. The GT2's fixed rear wing (made of CFRP for the post-2003 cars) appears to be a concession to racing rules that usually outlaw adjustable aerodynamic components. The GT2 had no rear seat and no air conditioning and came with a factory installed roll cage. Both the GT3 and GT2 were available only with a 6-speed manual transmission.

                    <h2>In Retrospect</h2>
                    <p>Is the 996 body style the perfect Porsche? Well, the interior is a plasticky hellscape letdown, and the engine isn’t quite as reliable as the previous aircooled motors, or as reliable as the direct-injection engines that followed in 2008. That said, it loves to rev, it’s still an incredibly analog driving experience, and in my opinion it looks good.

                        Most importantly the 996 is a vastly improved driving experience over the 993 that came before. While some in the Porsche faithful would have me burned at the stake for such blasphemes against the aircooled deity, it’s the truth. The 996 is more nimble, handles its weight balance better, more powerful, more sonorous, and ergonomically improved. You can daily drive a 996 much more easily than you can a 993, for certain.
                        
                        For the prices these are currently selling, they’re a bargain pure sports driving experience. Buy one. Even if you don’t think they are pretty, at least you don’t have to look at it from the driver’s seat.
                        
                        The 996 is good, y’all.
